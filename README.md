# bioinfo-bgc-project
Scripts for an individual research project - detecting biosynthetic gene clusters in fungi.

In this project I analysed fungal genomes for the detection of biosynthetic gene clusters.

• Tools used in command-line in Linux via Miniconda: ANTISMASH, DeepBGC, Funannotate.
• Python scripts for file conversion and a bash script for analysis execution.
• Data analysis in R.

Guided by prof. Cene Gostinčar. Data provided by doc. dr. Polona Zalar. As part of an voluntary individual project work at Biotechnical Faculty, University of Ljubljana, 2024.
